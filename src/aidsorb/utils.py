def pcd_from_file(filename, features=None):
    r"""
    Create molecular point cloud from a file.

    The molecular ``pcd`` has shape ``(N, 4+C)`` where ``N`` is the
    number of atoms, ``pcd[:, :3]`` are the **atomic coordinates**,
    ``pcd[:, 3]`` are the **atomic numbers** and ``pcd[:, 4:]`` any
    **additional** ``features``. If ``features=None``, then the only features
    are the atomic numbers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        Absolute or relative path to the file.
    features : list of str, optional
        See :func:`pcd_from_dir`.

    Returns
    -------
     data : tuple of length 2
        Molecular point cloud and its name as ``(name, pcd)``.

    Notes
    -----
    The ``name`` of the molecule is the basename of ``filename`` with its
    suffix removed.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # xyz coordinates + atomic number + electronegativity + radius
    >>> name, pcd = pcd_from_file('path/to/file', features=['en_pauling', 'atomic_radius'])
    ... # doctest: +SKIP

def pcd_from_files(filenames, outname, features=None):
    r"""
    Create molecular point clouds from a list of files and store them.

    Point clouds are stored under ``outname`` as ``.npy`` files.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filenames : iterable
        An iterable providing the filenames. Absolute or relative paths can be
        used.
    outname : str
        Directory name where the data will be stored.
    features: list of str, optional
        See :func:`pcd_from_dir`.

    Notes
    -----
    Molecules that can't be processed are omitted.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Create and store the point clouds.
    >>> outname = 'path/to/pcd_data'
    >>> pcd_from_files(['path/to/foo.xyz', 'path/to/bar.cif'], outname)  # doctest: +SKIP

def pcd_from_dir(dirname: str, outname: str, features: list[str] = None):
    r"""
    Create molecular point clouds from a directory and store them.

    Point clouds are stored under ``outname`` as ``.npy`` files.

    .. tip::
        To get a list of the supported chemical file formats see
        :func:`ase.io.read`. Alternatively, you can list them from the command line
        with: ``ase info --formats``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dirname : str
        Absolute or relative path to the directory.
    outname : str
        Directory name where the data will be stored.
    features: list of str, optional
        Elemental properties from `periodic table
        <https://mendeleev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/data.html#elements>`_.

    -----
